# Little Witch Nobeta

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All types of magics, bag upgrades, buff-, healing items, the starting arcane magic and boss souls can be shuffled,
and all locations in the game which could contain any of those items may have their contents changed.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit
certain items to your own world.

## What does another world's item look like in Little Witch Nobeta?

Currently all shuffled items are automatically picked up. So there is no way to distinguish items from
other worlds and your own.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, a message will pop up in the top right. Magics will be learned and upgraded automatically.
Bag upgrades increase item space automatically. Usable items will be placed in the inventory directly and if they do not
fit they will be replaced by souls. Trial keys are an exception to that rule and will replace the first item in the
inventory that is not a trial key and give some souls for deleting the old item.

## What is this randomizer based on?

This randomizer is based on (forked from) the wonderful work Eveldee did on Little Witch Nobeta - https://github.com/Eveldee/RandomizedWitchNobeta

## Some tips for playing Little Witch Nobeta randomized

<p>If the goal is magic master you will need all attack magics to be level 5 before being able to fight Nonota. If you reach her before you have all your magics leveled up, a prompt saying "Only the Magic Master may pass." will appear instead.</p>
<p>If the goal is boss hunter you will need all boss souls before being able to fight Nonota. If you reach her before you have all boss souls collected, a prompt saying "Only an accomplished Boss Hunter may pass." will appear instead.</p>

<p>In the secret passage and the underground a gate barrier has been removed to have more doors available for entrance randomization.</p>
